<strong>Job-related interests</strong><br>
If you had asked me what my job-related goal was three years ago, I would have told you that I would be a great and famous game programmer one day. So my focus the last years was on game programming only. But things changed and some experiences taught me all that glitters is not gold. I decided to be more open-minded and started making mobile apps and websites which had nothing in common with games. Against all odds this was fun for me as well and furthermore it's a lot easier to find a good job without moving to another country.<br><br>

<strong>Work experience</strong><br>
I started programming in 2010 doing an internship at kr3m media in Karlsruhe. Since then I found my passion to work as a programmer and started my freelancing-carreer. I worked on several game projects, made some websites and mobile apps.<br>
Since January 2015 I'm working as a mobile application developer at <a href="http://aaronprojects.de">aaronprojects GmbH</a>.
<br><br>

<strong>Leisure activities</strong> <br>
Besides programming I'm playing the drums in a funk band called <a href="http://the-cot.de" target="_blank">"Challenge of Tomorrow"</a> and in a party cover band called <a href="http://www.canis-band.de" target="_blank">"Canis"</a>. I'm also working on my own project called <a href="http://www.verry-on-drums.de" target="_blank">"Verry on Drums"</a> I'm also totally into bouldering, fitness, computer games, table soccer and of course going out with friends.<br><br>
