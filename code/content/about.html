<strong>Job-related interests</strong><br>
If you had asked me what my job-related goal was one year ago, I would have told you that I would be a great and famous game programmer one day. So my focus the last 3 years was on game programming only. But things changed and some experiences taught me all that glitters is not gold. I decided to be more open-minded and started making mobile apps and websites which had nothing in common with games. Against all odds this was fun for me as well and furthermore it's a lot easier to find a good job without moving to another country.<br><br>

<strong>Work experience</strong><br>
I started programming in 2010 doing an internship at kr3m media in Karlsruhe. Since then I found my passion to work as a programmer and started my freelancing-carreer. Up to now I worked on several game projects, made some websites and mobile apps.<br><br>

<strong>Leisure activities</strong> <br>
Besides programming I'm playing the drums in a pop/funk/rock band called <a href="http://challengeoftomorrow.de" target="_blank">"Challenge of Tomorrow"</a>. I also love to play computer games and table soccer and of course going out with friends.<br><br>
