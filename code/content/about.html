    Hey there, my name is Verena Zaiser, I'm 25 years old and I'm living in Stuttgart. At the moment I am studying Computer Science and Media at Stuttgart Media University 
    in Stuttgart-Vaihingen. My (Schwerpunkte) are Game Development and Mobile Development, especially Android. 
    I'm also interested in Web Development, but not that experienced yet. My passion for programming started at my Media and Communication Computer Science study in Reutlingen. 
    Since then I'm completely sure that I want to work as a programmer. (Seit dem) I worked on different projects as a programmer to get as much different experiences as possible. 
    (neben) I am also a working student (Werkstudent) for Sebastian Stein since 2,5 years and did some practica (praktikum) sat kr3m media GmBH at Karlsruhe. 
    An important stage at my carrier was working on the 2D-Point-and-Click adventure "The Inner World", which was titled to be the best German Game 2014.
    My hobbies are playing the drums in a rock band, computer games, playing table soccer and going out with friends.
